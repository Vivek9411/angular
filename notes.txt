angular is a single page application

#  Creating a component 
ng generate component componenet_name  or ng g c component name 









********** importan things to remember ********************
// string, number, boolern , date, object, array , null , undefined 
// creating a variable 
var_name: data_type  = value




***** this is one way data bending *****

**interpolation** 
// only the variable created in this class can be accesed in the html of roles
// to acces the value created in comopent class in that components html use {{}} # this is called as interpolation 


to print the data
use {{data_name}}  => data_name is defined in class inside the .ts file of that component 


** property binding ** 
to set the attribute dynamically use 
[attribute_name]='variable' like => [class]="class_name" where class_name is variable defined in .ts class 



***** two way data binding *****
works only in input 
imports: [FormsModule], # first import FormsModule
then use <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="firstName"> [(mgmodel)]="varname" to use two way databinding 
changes in input are rflected in variable in this case (firstname)




*** to add event lister type thing *** 
like on button click give alert 
 showalert (){
    alert("welcome to angular 20")
  }

  this is function defination and this goes in componen .ts file in side tht class 

# using in html
<button class="btn btn-success" (click)="showalert()"> show alert</button>  # inside the button tag add trigger type and then function which should be triggerd on that event
